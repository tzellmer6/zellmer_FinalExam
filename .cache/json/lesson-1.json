This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.</p>\n<p>An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. If you ever have a question like, \"What happens if I add an int to a list?\" Just typing it into the Python interpreter is a fast and likely the best way to see what happens.
